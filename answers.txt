Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: We might consider using Git for a variety or reasons, the main one for us woul$
because git allows us to make changes to files and such that are in projects, and it    
also allows you to manage the changes and it logs it so you can see who and when change$
were made. Because of this it works great for collaborative workspaces which is what this class has (group project)
